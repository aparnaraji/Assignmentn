		<p class="img_name">Landscape of Ashtamudi Lake</p>
		<p>Banks of Ashtamudi lake near Kollam in Kerala were our home for two days, on our way back home from Kanyakumari and Trivandrum. Google maps told me that the lake is fairly large. However, I needed to spend some time with it to understand its real size and more than size its life & soul. Ashtamudi is not very popular with tourists in Kerala as most of them prefer to stay in Kollam or in Kovalam further south. Others prefer to stay a bit north in Alleppey and Cochin.</p>

		<p class="img_name">Lunch on a luxury boat – Ashtamudi Lake</p>
		<p>As soon as we reached Kollam and checked into our hotel, we set out for a lunch on the boat. This was a huge boat and the table was set for two of us. A small team served us lunch as the boat moved over the quiet waters of Ashtamudi lake. It was a surreal experience as we ate and the scenery around us moved. The shape of the lake started making sense as we moved from its one arm to another.</p>

		<p class="img_name">Chinese Fishing Nets</p>
		<p>Slowly the ubiquitous Chinese fishing nets started making an appearance. They look perfect hanging from the banks overlooking the waters like a tea strainer in someone’s hand. More often than not, they are queued up together in bunches. They are a photographer’s delight. One can get lost in capturing them in different compositions. No wonder they are a popular image when we talk about Kerala coast. At places, the fishing nets were parked right in the middle of the lake. While at most places they were anchored to the shore. From a distance, they look like simple nets. It is when you take a close you realize how complex they are.</p>

		<p class="img_name">Colorful Fishing Boats parked on Ashtamudi Lake</p>
		<p>Colorful fishing boats were parked on the banks, next to the lovely houses. The fishing nets all folded appeared to be resting and rejuvenating for standing in the waters as the sun sets. The pristine environment here meant lots of birds. It is a pleasure to observe them as they fly from one green patch to another on the lake.</p>

		<p class="img_name">Kerala Houseboat on Ashtamudi Lake</p>
		<p>Some tourist houseboats crossed our paths but it never felt crowded. Either we were in the not so crowded part of the lake or the lake is big enough to let you have your solitude.Sun and clouds played their own role in creating a unique landscape for us. Coconut groves and palm trees demarcated the territory of water and sky with their green color. Islands appear like green dots floating in the water.</p>

		<p class="western">Even after 2 years of visiting Ashtamudi Lake, its memory is as fresh in my as it was the day I said goodbye to it.</p>
